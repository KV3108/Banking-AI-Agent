git push origin main


How to run?
conda activate cuda (if required to choose enviroment)
cd "path of the folder"
cd .. (to move out of the code folder)
conda deactivate 


The solution idea is to develop four parameters consisting of fraud detection, customer segmentation, 
transaction risk and customer churn prediction.

Fraud Detection
AI can analyze transactional data in real-time to identify unusual patterns and flag potentially fraudulent activities.We can continuously improve by learning from both successful and false-positive detections.

Transaction Risk
AI can assess the risk of individual transactions by considering various parameters such as transaction history, customer behavior, and external factors. It can then assign risk scores to each transaction, helping in making informed decisions about approvals or rejections.

Customer Segmentation
AI can segment customers based on their behaviors, preferences, and transaction history. This can help in targeted marketing campaigns, personalized offers, and better customer service, ultimately leading to higher customer satisfaction and retention.

Churn Prediction
AI can predict which customers are at risk of leaving the bank by analyzing their engagement levels, transaction patterns, and interactions. Early identification allows for proactive measures to retain these customers, such as personalized offers or improved services.

#Integrate the parameters with AI Agent.

AI Agent Architecture
1. Planning
Define the overall goals and structure of your AI agent. Create a roadmap for how the agent will achieve these goals using the four parameters you mentioned.

2. Processing
Set up the agent to handle data inputs, process them using NLP, and prepare them for decision-making.

3. Decision Making
Integrate your deep learning models for each parameter to enable the agent to make informed decisions based on the data processed.

4. Action
Design the agent to take appropriate actions based on the decisions made.

5. Learning from Feedback
Implement a feedback loop using DQN RL to allow the agent to learn and improve over time.

#How to enhance AI Agent Capabilities-
1. Plan or setting goals
                                    Personalized Services
AI can offer personalized recommendations and services to customers, enhancing their overall experience. For example, AI can suggest suitable financial products or investment opportunities based on a customer's profile and preferences.

3. NLP for Input Processing
Use GPT-based models to process and understand incoming data. This involves tokenizing the input, understanding the context, and preparing the data for decision-making.

4. Decision Logic
Integrate your deep learning models for fraud detection, transaction risk, churn prediction, and customer segmentation and use decision automation as stated below-
                                    Decision Automation
AI can automate routine decision-making processes, such as loan approvals, credit scoring, and transaction verification. This not only speeds up operations but also reduces the chance of human error.

4. Action Implementation
Based on the decisions, define the actions your agent will take. This could involve flagging transactions, sending alerts, updating user profiles, etc.

5. Learning with DQN RL
Implement a DQN RL algorithm for your agent to learn from feedback.AI agents can learn from new data and feedback, constantly improving their accuracy and effectiveness. This adaptability is crucial in a dynamic environment like banking, where new threats and opportunities frequently arise.
